## My process

This challenge was very straight forward, started with the card and filled in everything as shown in the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have a habit of making my solutions unecessarily complex, even for simple assignments like this.

### Continued development

I'd like to slow down and think of most practical solution of whatever problem I'm trying to solve.

Even a simple project like this can be a huge undertaking for someone who's just starting their coding journey or has only coded along to tutorials, but projects like this are a great way to build confidence and experience. I'm grateful to Frontend Mentor for hosting these projects. and [John Smilga](https://www.johnsmilga.com/) for having great tutorial content available for people like me to learn from.
